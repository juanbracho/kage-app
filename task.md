## ðŸš¨ **CRITICAL SESSION PRIORITIES (Session 14) - MOBILE DEBUGGING REQUIRED**

### **URGENT - BLOCKING PRODUCTION DEPLOYMENT**
1. **Task 12.22**: Debug mobile APK passcode failure - establish mobile debugging workflow *(8-12 hours)*
2. **Task 12.23**: Investigate mobile WebView vs web browser differences *(4-6 hours)*
3. **Task 12.24**: Verify Capacitor App plugin integration and event firing *(3-4 hours)*
4. **Task 12.25**: Mobile console logging and Android debugging setup *(2-3 hours)*
5. **Task 12.26**: Fix mobile lock state initialization and persistence timing *(4-6 hours)*

### **ALTERNATIVE APPROACH (IF MOBILE DEBUG FAILS)**
- **Plan B**: Implement simpler mobile-specific passcode mechanism *(6-8 hours)*
- **Plan C**: Disable mobile passcode temporarily, document limitation *(1-2 hours)*

### **BLOCKED UNTIL MOBILE PASSCODE RESOLVED**
- **Task 13.12-13.14**: Individual habit reminder system *(BLOCKED)*
- **Task 13.21**: Debug onboarding template creation issue *(BLOCKED)*
- **Task 13.15-13.16**: User account system foundation *(BLOCKED)*

### **SESSION 14 CRITICAL PATH**

### **SUCCESS CRITERIA FOR SESSION 14**
1. Mobile APK journal locks immediately when passcode enabled
2. Mobile APK journal stays locked across page navigation
3. Mobile APK journal locks when backgrounding/switching apps
4. Mobile APK journal remains locked on app restart
5. Mobile APK passcode entry unlocks journal properly
