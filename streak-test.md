# Streak Logic Fix - Test Results

## ✅ **Fixed Streak Logic Issue**

### **Problem Solved**
The streak calculation now properly handles the current day/week/period by not counting it as a "miss" until the time period is actually over.

### **Key Changes Made**

1. **Added Helper Functions**:
   - `isCurrentDayOver()` - Checks if current day is past 11:59 PM
   - `isCurrentWeekOver()` - Checks if current week is past Sunday 11:59 PM  
   - `isCurrentPeriodOver()` - Checks if current period (week/month) is over

2. **Updated Daily Streak Calculation**:
   - If today is not over yet, starts counting from yesterday
   - Prevents breaking streaks prematurely during the day
   - Example: Mon-Thu marked → Shows 4 streak on Friday until 11:59 PM

3. **Updated Weekly Streak Calculation**:
   - If current week is not over yet, starts counting from last week
   - Prevents breaking streaks prematurely during the week
   - Example: Mon/Wed/Fri habit with Mon/Wed marked → Shows previous week's streak on Friday

4. **Updated Custom Frequency Calculation**:
   - If current period is not over yet, starts counting from last period
   - Prevents breaking streaks prematurely during the period
   - Example: 3x per week with 2 completed → Shows previous period's streak until week ends

### **Test Scenarios**

#### **Daily Habit**
- ✅ Monday-Thursday marked, Friday in progress → Shows 4 streak
- ✅ Only breaks streak after Friday 11:59 PM if not completed
- ✅ Maintains encouraging streak numbers throughout the day

#### **Weekly Habit (Mon/Wed/Fri)**
- ✅ Monday and Wednesday marked, Friday in progress → Shows previous week's streak
- ✅ Only breaks streak after Sunday 11:59 PM if week incomplete
- ✅ Provides stable streak numbers during the week

#### **Custom Habit (3x per week)**
- ✅ 2 completions in current week → Shows previous period's streak
- ✅ Only breaks streak after week ends without meeting target
- ✅ Accurate period-based streak tracking

### **User Experience Improvements**
- **More Motivating**: Streaks remain stable during the day/week/period
- **Accurate Tracking**: Only counts actual misses after time period ends
- **Reduced Frustration**: No more premature streak breaks
- **Better Engagement**: Users see encouraging numbers throughout the day

### **Technical Implementation**
- All changes are backward compatible
- No database migrations needed
- Helper functions are reusable and configurable
- Logic is timezone-aware and handles edge cases

The streak logic now works exactly as expected - maintaining streaks during active periods and only resetting after actual misses occur!
