# Project Kage - Consolidated App Definition

**Goal**: Build a focused, clean productivity app that stands strongly on its own before adding AI superpowers, with potential for health app spinoff "Renkei".

## **THE CORE IDEA**
**Kage** is a comprehensive productivity app that combines habit tracking, goal setting, task management, and journaling. The app works completely on its own as a powerful productivity system, but becomes **exponentially more valuable** with the optional AI companion upgrade - making the AI feel absolutely essential once experienced.

## **FREEMIUM BUSINESS MODEL**
- **FREE TIER**: Complete productivity suite (goals, habits, tasks, journals, scheduling, community)
- **PREMIUM TIER**: AI companion "Kage" that supercharges every feature with intelligence
- **Strategy**: Make the free app so good that it hooks users, then make AI so transformative they can't imagine using the app without it
