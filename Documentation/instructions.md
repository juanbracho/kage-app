### When I need to give you feedback for multiple actionable items I will add them here as we converse to make the prompts easier.

## General - Not urgent, Idea for the future. 
1. If frequency is changed streak needs to be mantain from that they to the past. I added a habit for Tu,Th and S and marked 3 weeks as completed. My current streak is 3 weeks BUT, then I change to M, W, F and I lost my streak. The logic should when there is a change log the period of time for which that streak logic should be calculated starting with from creation to always and then, onces there is a change the initial stops when edit and the edit starts a new period. We need a way to create this logic for this scenarios. 

## Habit rework
1. Remove how should completions be tracked. And leave Simple Yes/No by default. 
2. Add in task.md that for future implementation we will re add this with proper funcitonality for custon, count and time.
