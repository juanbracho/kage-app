- All feedback organized and prioritized in `next_steps.md`
- **CRITICAL BUG FIXES COMPLETED**:

#### 🐛 Task 5.1: Dashboard High Priority Task Display Bug ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: High priority tasks were not appearing in dashboard at all
**Root Cause**: Dashboard logic excluded both `high` and `urgent` priority tasks from Today's Tasks, while only including `urgent` in Urgent section
**Solution**: Modified `getUrgentTasks()` to include both `urgent` AND `high` priority tasks, and `getTodayTasks()` to only exclude `urgent` priority tasks
**Result**: High priority tasks now properly display in dashboard

#### 🐛 Task 5.3: Goal Task Editing Duplication Bug ✅ FIXED  
**Problem**: Editing tasks in goal details modal created duplicates instead of updating existing tasks
**Root Cause**: `handleTaskSubmit()` always called `addTask()` regardless of edit vs create mode
**Solution**: Added conditional logic to use `updateTask(editingTask.id, taskData)` when editing, `addTask(taskData)` when creating
**Result**: Task editing now updates existing tasks instead of duplicating

#### 🐛 Dashboard Duplicate Tasks Bug ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: Tasks appeared in BOTH Urgent and Today's Tasks sections (user feedback from screenshot)
**Root Cause**: No deduplication between urgent and today's task sections
**Solution**: 
- Refined `getUrgentTasks()` to only include truly urgent items (overdue, urgent priority, imminent deadlines)
- Updated `getTodayTasks()` to exclude any task IDs already in urgent section
- Added Set-based deduplication to prevent task duplicates
**Result**: Clean dashboard with proper task separation - each task appears in exactly one section

### 🚧 Session 31 Incomplete Tasks

## Session 16 | 2025-08-06

### Completed Tasks
- ✅ Fixed HabitKit import invalid date errors with robust date parsing
- ✅ Removed legacy export option, kept only Complete Backup & Custom Selection
- ✅ Enhanced journal passcode system with live countdown and interaction resets

### Issues Identified - Journal Passcode

#### CRITICAL REMAINING ISSUE
**Problem**: Journal not immediately locked when passcode enabled
- Current: Journal accessible until auto-lock timer expires  
- Expected: Journal locked immediately upon passcode enable
- Also: Journal should lock on app restart if passcode enabled

#### Current State
- ✅ Settings UI works perfectly
- ✅ Passcode encryption/validation works
- ✅ Auto-lock timer functions
- ✅ Countdown displays correctly
- ❌ **Initial lock state broken**: Journal accessible without passcode until timer expires

#### Next Steps Required
1. **Fix initial lock logic**: Journal should start locked when passcode enabled
2. **Fix app restart behavior**: Journal should be locked on app launch if passcode protection active  
3. **Timer should start at 0**: No grace period - immediate protection

### Technical Analysis
The issue is in the lock state logic - currently checks `!lastAccessTime || shouldAutoLock()` but needs to handle "fresh passcode setup" vs "timeout expired" differently.

### Files Modified This Session
- `DataImportModal.tsx` - Fixed HabitKit date parsing
- `DataExportModal.tsx` - Removed legacy export option  
- `JournalPage.tsx` - Enhanced countdown and interaction handling
- `settingsStore.ts` - Passcode setup improvements

### Build Status
- **APK**: `kage-v1.4.4-final-debug.apk` (4.3MB)
- **Status**: Partial - passcode needs immediate lock fix

---
**Next Session Goal**: Fix journal immediate lock on passcode enable & app restart, then move to new features

### 🔄 Repetitive Tasks Filter Implementation (Major Feature Addition)
**Issue Identified**: Critical bug in task creation - repetitive task properties not being copied from form data

#### ✅ Complete Implementation:
1. **New "Repetitive" Filter Tab**: Added between Upcoming and Overdue with Repeat icon
2. **Smart Grouping System**: 
   - Upcoming section (within 2 weeks) with blue styling
   - Monthly sections (August 2025, September 2025, etc.) with proper chronological sorting
3. **Enhanced Repetitive Task Cards**: 
   - Repetitive badge showing recurrence type and instance count
   - "Next: [date]" labeling for clarity
   - Purple repeat icons for visual distinction
4. **Main View Filtering**: Only shows next occurrence within month for repetitive tasks in Today/Upcoming/Overdue views
5. **Complete UI Integration**: Proper counts, responsive design, full task functionality

#### 🐛 Critical Bug Discovered:
**Problem**: `addTask()` function missing repetitive task properties from form data
- **Symptom**: Repetitive tasks appear as normal tasks initially
- **Root Cause**: TaskFormData properties (`isRecurring`, `recurrenceType`, etc.) not copied to Task object
- **Impact**: Recurring task generation fails, tasks disappear on edit
- **Status**: Identified but not yet fixed

#### Files Modified:
- `src/types/task.ts` - Added 'repetitive' to TaskFilter type
- `src/components/TasksPage.tsx` - Complete repetitive filter UI implementation
- `src/store/taskStore.ts` - Added filtering logic, missing property copying fix needed

**Next Steps**: Fix `addTask()` function to properly copy recurring properties from TaskFormData to Task object

### 🚨 Critical Issues Found After Bug Fix

#### ✅ **Repetitive Task Creation Fix Applied**
- Fixed `addTask()` function to copy recurring properties  
- Fixed `updateTask()` function to handle recurring changes
- Fixed TasksPage onSubmit type conversion

#### 🐛 **New Issues Identified Through Testing:**

##### Issue 1: **Dashboard Showing Too Many Instances**
**Problem**: Dashboard "Today's Focus" showing 5 duplicate "haircut" tasks
- **Expected**: Only 1 instance (next occurrence) should appear
- **Actual**: All generated recurring instances appearing
- **Root Cause**: Dashboard not using `filterNextOccurrenceOnly()` function
- **Impact**: Dashboard cluttered with duplicate tasks

##### Issue 2: **Tasks Not Appearing in Main Today Filter**  
**Problem**: Tasks due today not showing in main Tasks page Today filter
- **Expected**: Recurring tasks due today should appear in Today tab
- **Actual**: Today tab completely empty despite having tasks due today
- **Root Cause**: Filtering logic excluding recurring tasks incorrectly
- **Impact**: Users can't see today's recurring tasks in main task view

##### Issue 3: **Repetitive Filter Showing Tasks Beyond 2 Weeks**
**Problem**: "Upcoming" section showing tasks over 3 weeks out
- **Expected**: Upcoming section should only show tasks within 2 weeks
- **Actual**: Tasks due 8/26/2025 and 9/9/2025 appearing in Upcoming section
- **Current Date**: 8/6/2025 (tasks are 20+ and 34+ days out)
- **Root Cause**: `isUpcoming` logic in repetitive filtering incorrect
- **Impact**: Wrong categorization of repetitive tasks

##### Issue 4: **Tasks Not Appearing in Calendar**
**Problem**: Recurring tasks not showing as all-day events in calendar
- **Expected**: Repetitive tasks should appear as all-day events like milestones
- **Actual**: Calendar shows empty timeline with only "Tap to add" slots
- **Root Cause**: Recurring tasks not being created as calendar time blocks
- **Impact**: No calendar integration for repetitive tasks

#### 📋 **Required Fixes:**
1. Update Dashboard to use `filterNextOccurrenceOnly()` for recurring tasks
2. Fix Today filter logic to properly include today's recurring tasks
3. Correct `isUpcoming` calculation in repetitive filter (should be exactly ≤14 days)
4. Implement automatic calendar time block creation for repetitive tasks
5. Ensure repetitive tasks appear as all-day events in calendar timeline

#### 📅 **Test Case Reference:**
- Task: "haircut" - weekly recurring  
- Current Date: August 6, 2025
- Next Due: August 26, 2025 (20 days out - should be in Monthly, not Upcoming)
- Following Due: September 9, 2025 (34 days out - should be in September section)
