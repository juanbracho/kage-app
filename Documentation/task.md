#### Session 4.7 - Issue Analysis & Onboarding Planning (2025-07-26)
**Status**: 🔍 ANALYSIS COMPLETE  
**Focus**: Analyze remaining calendar issues and plan onboarding flow implementation

**Analysis Results:**
**Calendar Sync Issue Root Causes:**
- **Task Interface Consistency**: Both `Task` and `TaskFormData` interfaces properly include `addToCalendar?: boolean` field
- **Store Logic Flow**: `addTask()` method correctly processes form data and calls calendar integration
- **Debugging Infrastructure**: Comprehensive logging shows process flow but may not reveal persistence failures
- **Potential Issue**: Data persistence between form submission and task storage may be dropping the `addToCalendar` field

**Edit Modal State Issue Analysis:**
- **Symptom**: `addToCalendar` toggle shows as off during task editing, while `isRecurring` toggle persists correctly
- **Root Cause**: Likely in task data serialization/deserialization or form initialization logic
- **Technical Detail**: Both fields use same interface structure but different persistence behavior suggests field-specific handling issue

**Onboarding Flow Planning (Phase 7.5):**
**Based on `/Documentation/html-mockups/general/kage-onboarding-flow.html` analysis:**

**Step 1: Welcome Screen**

  - **Store Logic Updated**: ✅ Updated both `getWeekViewData()` and `getMonthViewData()` to use Sunday-first weeks
  - **Day Names Reordered**: ✅ Updated day name arrays from ['Mon'...] to ['Sun', 'Mon', 'Tue'...] 
  - **Consistent Calendar Views**: ✅ All calendar views now use Sunday-first week structure
  - **Remaining Issue**: ❌ Dates still off by -1 day (showing Sun 19, Mon 20... instead of Sun 20, Mon 21...)
  - **Debug System**: ✅ Added comprehensive logging to identify root cause of date offset
  - **Next Step**: Fix week start calculation to show correct Sunday for current week

- **WEEKLY CALENDAR VIEW COMPLETE REDESIGN (100% COMPLETE)** 📅✅
  - **Architectural Restructure**: Completely rebuilt from horizontal time-slot layout to vertical day-column layout
  - **Target Design Achieved**: Now matches mockup exactly with single time column + 7 day columns 
  - **Full Week Visibility**: All 7 days (Mon-Sun) now visible simultaneously without any horizontal scrolling
  - **Clean Day Headers**: Day abbreviations and numbers cleanly displayed at top of each column
  - **Single Time Column**: Time labels (6AM-8PM) shown only once on left side, eliminating repetition

- **CALENDAR EVENT EDITING FIX (100% COMPLETE)** 📅✅
  - **Issue Identified**: Calendar edit modal was opening and allowing changes but not saving them to store
  - **Root Cause**: `onEdit` prop in CalendarViews.tsx was only logging to console instead of calling `updateTimeBlock`
  - **Data Flow Fix**: Connected EventDetailModal's `handleSaveEdit` → `onEdit` → `handleEventEdit` → `updateTimeBlock`
  - **Data Transformation**: Added proper conversion from CalendarEvent format to TimeBlock format
  - **Duration Calculation**: Implemented startTime + endTime → durationMinutes conversion logic

## 📝 SESSION 16 SUMMARY & NEXT STEPS

### Session Accomplishments
1. **Calendar Event Editing**: ✅ Fixed complete data flow from modal to store persistence
2. **Weekly Calendar Redesign**: ✅ Complete architectural overhaul to vertical day-column layout  
3. **Time Format Consistency**: ✅ Standardized military time across Day and Week views
4. **Sunday Week Start**: ✅ Changed from Monday-first to Sunday-first week structure
5. **Debug System Implementation**: ✅ Added comprehensive logging for date calculation issues

### Current Status
- **Calendar Module**: 95% ready for beta testing
- **Remaining Issue**: Date calculation still shows dates 1 day early (Sun 19 vs Sun 20)
- **Root Cause**: Week start calculation needs fine-tuning for proper Sunday detection

### Next Session Priority
1. **Fix Date Offset**: Debug and correct the -1 day offset in week start calculation
2. **Remove Debug Logging**: Clean up console.log statements once issue is resolved  
3. **Final Testing**: Verify all calendar views show correct dates and events
4. **Beta Release**: Calendar module ready for user testing

### Technical Notes
- Week calculation logic in `getWeekViewData()` needs adjustment
- Current: `startOfWeek.setDate(startOfWeek.getDate() - day)`
- Issue: Finding previous Sunday instead of current week's Sunday
- Solution: Verify `currentDate` value and adjust calculation accordingly

## 🔄 Habit System Simplification (2025-07-24)

### Current Implementation Status
**Habit Measurement Types Simplified**: During Session 15, we implemented a comprehensive habit system with multiple measurement types (simple, count, time, custom). However, this created complexity in the user interface and interaction patterns. 

**Decision**: Simplified to **Simple Yes/No habits only** for better user experience and cleaner implementation.

### Future Implementation Roadmap
The following advanced habit measurement types will be re-implemented in **Phase 7: Advanced Features** with proper functionality:

#### 7.4 Advanced Habit Measurement System
**Estimated Time**: 2 weeks | **Priority**: MEDIUM | **Target**: Phase 7

**Features to Re-implement**:
- [ ] **Count-Based Habits**: Multiple completions per day with target amounts
  - Visual progress rings showing current count vs target (e.g., "3/8 glasses of water")
  - Incremental counting with tap-to-increment interface
  - Smart progress tracking and completion celebration at target reached
  - Count-based streak calculation and analytics
  
- [x] **Time-Based Habits**: Duration tracking with timer integration ✅ **COMPLETED 2025-07-28**
  - Built-in timer functionality for meditation, exercise, reading
  - Time-based goal setting (e.g., "20 minutes of reading daily")
  - Progress visualization with time completion indicators
  - Integration with focus timer and Pomodoro technique
  
- [x] **Custom Measurement Habits**: Flexible units and tracking ✅ **COMPLETED 2025-07-28**
  - User-defined measurement units (pages, miles, calories, etc.)
  - Custom target setting with flexible completion criteria
  - Advanced analytics for custom measurements
  - Visual progress indicators adapted to measurement type

**Implementation Notes**:
- Count-based habits should use `incrementHabitCount()` method for calendar interactions
- Time-based habits require timer integration and duration tracking
- Custom habits need flexible UI components that adapt to measurement type
- All measurement types should maintain streak calculation consistency
- Progress visualization should be context-aware based on measurement type

**Technical Requirements**:
- Enhanced `habitStore.ts` with measurement-specific methods
- Dynamic UI components that render based on habit measurement type
- Advanced analytics engine for different measurement patterns
- Integration with calendar system for scheduled habit time blocks

**User Experience Goals**:
- Intuitive interaction patterns for each measurement type
- Clear visual feedback for progress toward goals
- Seamless transition between different habit measurement types
- Consistent streak and analytics across all measurement types

- [ ] **Template Customization**: User ability to modify templates before applying
- [x] **Template Import/Export**: User-created templates and sharing system ✅ **COMPLETED 2025-07-28**

**Template Categories to Implement**:
```json
{
  "productivity": {
    "goals": ["Complete Certification", "Learn New Skill", "Start Side Business"],
    "tasks": ["Project Planning", "Research & Development", "Content Creation"],
    "habits": ["Daily Learning", "Morning Routine", "Deep Work Blocks"],
