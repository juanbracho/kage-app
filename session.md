# Kage App - Session Log

## Session 1 | 2025-08-01

### Summary
Comprehensive bug fixes addressing user feedback on time blocking persistence, modal auto-opening, subtask state management, and import/export relationship preservation.

### Issues Fixed
1. **Time Blocking Details Not Saving**
   - Enhanced calendar store persistence with improved partialize function
   - Added comprehensive debugging and state hydration recovery
   - Implemented custom storage layer with error handling and retry logic

2. **Task Modal Auto-Opening on First Visit**
   - Added initialization state flag to prevent premature modal opening
   - Improved event listener management with proper lifecycle handling
   - Fixed race condition between component mounting and custom events

3. **Subtask Checkmarks Resetting on Edit**
   - Standardized subtask data structure throughout the application
   - Enhanced TaskCreationModal to preserve completion states during edits
   - Improved task store handling of mixed string/object subtask formats
   - Added original subtask state preservation during edit operations

4. **Import/Export Goal-Task-Habit Linking Issues**
   - Implemented dependency-aware import ordering (goals → habits → tasks → timeblocks)
   - Added comprehensive ID mapping system for relationship preservation
   - Enhanced export format with relationship metadata (version 1.1.0)
   - Implemented validation and verification of reconstructed relationships

### Improvements Made
- **Calendar Store**: Added robust persistence, debugging, and state recovery
- **Task Store**: Improved subtask consistency and edit state preservation
- **Import/Export**: Full relationship preservation with backup and rollback
- **UI State Management**: Fixed modal auto-opening and event handling
- **Data Integrity**: Comprehensive validation and error recovery mechanisms

### Technical Enhancements
- Enhanced Zustand persistence with custom storage handlers

- Performance optimization based on usage patterns
- Additional testing and validation in production environment

### Files Modified
- `src/store/calendarStore.ts` - Enhanced persistence and debugging
- `src/store/taskStore.ts` - Improved subtask handling and data consistency
- `src/components/TasksPage.tsx` - Fixed auto-opening modal issue
- `src/components/TaskCreationModal.tsx` - Preserved subtask states during edit
- `src/components/DataExportModal.tsx` - Added relationship metadata to exports
- `src/components/DataImportModal.tsx` - Implemented dependency-aware import with ID mapping

### Status
✅ All reported issues resolved and tested
✅ Enhanced data integrity and relationship preservation
✅ Improved user experience and reliability

## Session 32 | 2025-08-04

### Summary
