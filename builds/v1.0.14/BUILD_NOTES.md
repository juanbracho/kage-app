# Kage v1.4.2 - Real-Time Milestone Updates Fix

**Release Date**: January 5, 2025  
**Build Status**: ✅ Production Ready - Real-Time Updates Fixed  
**APK File**: `kage-v1.4.2-milestone-realtime-debug.apk` (4.4 MB)

## 🔧 Critical Fix: Real-Time Milestone Updates

### Issue Resolved
**Problem**: Milestone updates were not reflecting in real-time. Users had to exit and re-enter the goal detail view to see:
- Newly added milestones
- Milestone completion status changes
- Milestone deletions
- Updated milestone counts

### Root Cause Analysis
The GoalDetail component was using a static `goal` prop passed from the parent component instead of subscribing to live updates from the goal store. This meant:
- Component showed stale data from initial render
- Store updates weren't reflected in the UI
- User actions appeared to fail when they were actually successful

### Technical Solution

#### Core Fix Implementation
**Before (Problematic)**:
```typescript
// Component used static goal prop throughout
export default function GoalDetail({ goal, onBack, onEdit, onNavigate }: GoalDetailProps) {
  // All references used static 'goal'
  <h1>{goal.name}</h1>
  <span>{goal.milestones.length}</span>
  {goal.milestones.map(milestone => ...)}
}
```

**After (Fixed)**:
```typescript
// Component now subscribes to live store data
export default function GoalDetail({ goal, onBack, onEdit, onNavigate }: GoalDetailProps) {
  const { goals, ...otherStoreMethods } = useGoalStore();
  
  // Get live goal data for real-time updates
  const currentGoal = goals.find(g => g.id === goal.id) || goal;
  
  // Use currentGoal for dynamic data, original goal for static styling
  <h1>{currentGoal.name}</h1>
  <span>{currentGoal.milestones.length}</span>
  {currentGoal.milestones.map(milestone => ...)}
}
```

#### Updated References
**Dynamic Data** (now uses `currentGoal`):
- Goal name, description, progress
- Milestone count and list
- Milestone completion status
- Due dates and creation dates
- Task and habit counts

**Static Styling** (still uses original `goal`):
- Goal color and icon (doesn't change)
- Button styling and themes

### Files Modified
- **`src/components/GoalDetail.tsx`**
  - Added live goal store subscription
  - Updated 20+ references from `goal` to `currentGoal`
  - Maintained backward compatibility for styling
