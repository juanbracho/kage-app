# Journal Passcode Protection - Implementation Status

## 🟢 **Working Components**

### Settings Implementation ✅
- **Passcode Setup**: 4-digit passcode creation with SHA-256 encryption
- **Passcode Change**: Current passcode validation + new passcode setup
- **Passcode Disable**: Secure disable with current passcode verification
- **Auto-Lock Timeout**: Configuration options (1min, 5min, 15min, 30min, never)
- **Settings UI**: Complete modal system with validation and error handling

### Backend Security ✅
- **Encryption**: SHA-256 hashing with unique device salt
- **Validation**: Secure passcode verification
- **State Management**: Proper Zustand store integration
- **Memory Safety**: Sensitive data cleanup on operations

## 🟡 **Partially Working**

### Auto-Lock System ⚠️
- **Timer Functionality**: Auto-lock triggers after timeout period
- **Warning Display**: 30-second warning message appears correctly
- **Lock Activation**: Journal does lock when timer expires

## 🔴 **Issues Identified**

### 1. Journal Not Locked on App Start ❌
**Problem**: Journal is accessible immediately after setting up passcode
- Settings show passcode as enabled
- Journal page doesn't check initial lock state properly
- Only locks after auto-lock timer expires, not on first access

### 2. Countdown Display Bug ❌
**Problem**: Warning countdown doesn't decrement visually
- Warning message shows "Journal will auto-lock in X seconds"
- Timer value doesn't update (stays at initial value)
- Lock still triggers correctly after timeout period

## 🔧 **Technical Analysis**

### Root Cause - Initial Lock State
```typescript
// Current logic in JournalPage.tsx
const shouldLock = !settings.passcode.lastAccessTime || shouldAutoLock()

// Issue: This logic doesn't work for fresh passcode setup
// When passcode is first enabled, app needs to lock immediately
```

### Root Cause - Countdown Display  
```typescript
// Current logic in useAutoLock.ts and JournalPage.tsx  
const [autoLockWarning, setAutoLockWarning] = useState<number | null>(null)

// Issue: Warning value is set once but never updated
// Need interval to decrement the displayed countdown
```

## 📋 **Required Fixes**

### 1. Fix Initial Lock State
- Journal should lock immediately when passcode is first enabled
- Journal should lock on app startup if passcode protection is active
- Need to differentiate between "first setup" and "timeout expired" lock states

### 2. Fix Countdown Display
- Implement proper countdown timer that decrements every second
- Update warning display to show accurate remaining time
- Ensure countdown stops when warning is dismissed or lock occurs

## 🏗️ **Implementation Strategy (When Resuming)**

### Phase 1: Fix Initial Lock
1. Add "force lock" state for fresh passcode setup
2. Modify journal mount logic to check passcode enabled state
3. Implement immediate lock on passcode enable action

### Phase 2: Fix Countdown
1. Create countdown interval in auto-lock warning state
2. Update warning display every second
3. Clear interval on warning dismiss or lock trigger

## 📱 **Current Build Status**
- **Build**: v1.4.4-fixed (still has issues)
- **APK**: `kage-v1.4.4-fixed-debug.apk` 
- **Settings**: Fully functional ✅
- **Journal Lock**: Needs fixes ❌

## 🎯 **User Impact**
- **Positive**: All passcode setup and management works perfectly
- **Negative**: Journal isn't actually protected until timer expires
- **Security Risk**: Medium - settings appear secure but protection is delayed

---

**Status**: PAUSED - Core functionality works, UI issues remain  
**Priority**: High - Security feature should work completely  
**Next Steps**: Address initial lock state and countdown display when ready to resume
