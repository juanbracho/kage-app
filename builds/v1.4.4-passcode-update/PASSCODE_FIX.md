# Passcode Protection Bug Fix

## 🐛 Issue Identified
The journal passcode protection was not working because:

1. **Setup Logic Issue**: When a passcode was set up, it immediately set `lastAccessTime` to current time, which meant the journal appeared "unlocked" right after setup.

2. **Lock State Logic**: The journal only checked `shouldAutoLock()` to determine if it should be locked, but this function returns `false` when there's no `lastAccessTime` or when the timeout hasn't been exceeded.

## 🔧 Fix Applied

### 1. Modified `setupPasscode` Method
**File**: `src/store/settingsStore.ts:337`
```typescript
// BEFORE
lastAccessTime: Date.now()

// AFTER  
lastAccessTime: undefined // Don't set lastAccessTime on setup - journal should be locked
```

### 2. Enhanced Journal Lock Logic
**File**: `src/components/JournalPage.tsx:60`
```typescript
// BEFORE
const shouldLock = shouldAutoLock()

// AFTER
const shouldLock = !settings.passcode.lastAccessTime || shouldAutoLock()
```

### 3. Added Debug Logging
- Added console logging to track passcode setup success
- Added console logging to track journal lock state decisions
- Added proper dependency tracking for useEffect

## 🎯 Expected Behavior After Fix

1. **Passcode Setup**: When a passcode is first enabled, the journal should immediately be locked
2. **First Access**: User must enter their passcode to unlock the journal
3. **Auto-Lock**: Journal locks after the configured timeout period
4. **State Persistence**: Unlock state is maintained until auto-lock timeout

## 📱 Build Details
- **Fixed APK**: `kage-v1.4.4-fixed-debug.apk`
- **Size**: ~4.3MB
- **Build Time**: August 6, 2025

## 🧪 Testing Instructions
1. Install the fixed APK
2. Go to Settings → Security & Passcode
3. Enable "Journal Passcode" and set a 4-digit code
4. Navigate to Journal page - it should show the lock screen
5. Enter your passcode - journal should unlock
6. Wait for auto-lock timeout or switch apps - journal should lock again

## 🔍 Debug Console Output
When testing, check browser/WebView console for:
- `✅ Passcode setup successful` with settings object
- `🔒 Journal lock check:` with lock state details
- `✅ Journal unlocked successfully` when passcode is entered correctly
