# Kage App v1.3.1-final Build Notes

**Build Date**: 2025-01-05  
**Version**: v1.3.1-final  
**Build Type**: Debug APK  
**File**: `kage-v1.3.1-final-debug.apk`

## Overview

This build completes the v1.3.x series with critical white screen and shopping toggle bug fixes. This is the **stable production-ready** release addressing all User Notes issues, export functionality, and recently discovered critical bugs.

## 🚨 **Critical Bug Fixes in v1.3.1**

### **White Screen Issue** (**CRITICAL** - ✅ FIXED)
**Issue**: v1.3.0-complete APK was displaying white screen on launch

**Root Cause**: Capacitor import issues in web build context causing JavaScript errors

**Solution Implemented**:
- **Conditional Imports**: Replaced static Capacitor imports with dynamic require() wrapped in try-catch
- **Safety Checks**: Added null checking for all Capacitor modules before usage
- **Graceful Fallback**: App now falls back to web APIs when Capacitor modules aren't available

**Code Fix**:
```typescript
// OLD: Static imports causing white screen
import { Capacitor } from '@capacitor/core';
import { Filesystem, Directory, Encoding } from '@capacitor/filesystem';

// NEW: Dynamic conditional imports
let Capacitor: any = null;
let Filesystem: any = null;
try {
  Capacitor = require('@capacitor/core').Capacitor;
  const FilesystemModule = require('@capacitor/filesystem');
  Filesystem = FilesystemModule.Filesystem;
  // ... with safety checks
} catch (error) {
  console.log('Capacitor modules not available in web build');
}
```

**Files Modified**: `src/components/DataExportModal.tsx`

**Impact**: App now launches successfully on all platforms

### **Shopping Item Toggle Bug** (**HIGH PRIORITY** - ✅ FIXED)
**Issue**: Shopping items in to-buy tasks affecting each other's completion states randomly

**Root Cause**: ID collision and loss during task editing - shopping items losing their unique IDs

**Problems Found**:
1. **Missing Shopping Item Handling**: `updateTask()` function handled subtasks but not shopping items
2. **ID Loss During Editing**: When editing tasks, shopping items were losing their IDs and completion states
3. **Index-Based Confusion**: Shopping items were being identified by array index instead of unique ID

**Solution Implemented**:

**1. Enhanced updateTask Function**:
```typescript
// Added shopping item preservation in taskStore.ts
if (updates.shoppingItems) {
  updatedTask.shoppingItems = updates.shoppingItems.map((item: any, index: number) => {
    if (item && typeof item === 'object') {
      return {
        id: item.id || `${id}-shop-${index}-${Date.now()}`,
        name: item.name,
        quantity: item.quantity || '1',
        completed: item.completed !== undefined ? item.completed : false
      };
    }
    return item;
  });
}
```

**2. Enhanced Task Editing**:
```typescript
// Added proper shopping item handling in TaskCreationModal.tsx
if (editingTask && editingTask.shoppingItems && editingTask.shoppingItems[index]) {
  const originalItem = editingTask.shoppingItems[index];
  return {
    id: originalItem.id || `shop-${index}-${Date.now()}`,
    name: item.name.trim(),
    quantity: item.quantity || '1',
    completed: originalItem.completed || false  // Preserve completion state
  };
}
```

**Files Modified**:
- `src/store/taskStore.ts` - Added shopping item handling to updateTask function
- `src/components/TaskCreationModal.tsx` - Enhanced shopping item preservation during editing

**Impact**: Shopping items now maintain their completion states correctly when tasks are edited
