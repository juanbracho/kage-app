# Kage App - Next Steps & Development Roadmap

**Date**: January 5, 2025  
**Current Status**: White Screen Resolved, Goal Templates System Operational  
**Production APK**: `kage-v1.4.0-onboarding-template-fix-debug.apk`

## üö® IMMEDIATE PRIORITY: Onboarding Template Creation Debug

### Issue Description
While the Goal Templates System works perfectly from the Goals page (creating complete goal structures with all tasks and habits), the onboarding template selection still doesn't create goals despite implementing the `completeOnboarding()` enhancement.

### Investigation Plan
1. **Console Logging Analysis**: Add browser dev tools to check if onboarding completion logs are appearing
2. **Template Data Verification**: Confirm `onboardingData.selectedTemplate` contains correct template data
3. **Store State Inspection**: Verify goalStore.createGoalFromTemplate is being called successfully
4. **Async Timing Issues**: Check if onboarding completion happens before template loading completes
5. **Error Handling**: Ensure any template creation errors are being caught and logged

### Expected Root Causes
- **Timing Issue**: Template loading may not be complete when onboarding finishes
- **Store State**: onboardingData may be cleared before template creation executes
- **Error Swallowing**: Template creation errors may be failing silently
- **Component Integration**: Onboarding flow may not be properly calling the enhanced completeOnboarding function
